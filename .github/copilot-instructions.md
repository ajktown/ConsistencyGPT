## ⚙️ Build & Validation Instructions

Follow these steps precisely to set up the environment and validate your changes.

### 1. Prerequisites & Setup

1.  **Node.js & npm**: Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. The required version is specified in the `.nvmrc` file. If you use `nvm`, simply run `nvm use` in the root directory.
2.  **Environment Variables**: This project requires environment variables for configuration (e.g., database credentials, JWT secrets).
    * Copy the example environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
    * ⚠️ **You must fill in the required values in the newly created `.env` file.** The application will fail to start without the correct database and other critical configurations.
